Empiricism relies on:

    facts
    evidence
    experience

It is making progress leveraging feedback from reality, not a plan. There is three pillards to it

The first is Transparency in how the team work and share information. Each member as the courage to share both good and bad news. In doing so, they all trust each others and work towards a shared objective. The client is aware can Inspect their work at any moment. The team communicate with the client every day to gather their feedback.

The second is Inspection of all the members of the team, their work, their process and their practices. Any change resulting from it is welcome as an opportunity to create more value. This is because it brings new interaction and occasion to test new hypothesis.

The third is adaptation, the ability evolve from the results of the inspection. Just ask yourself, are you better off today than yesterday? Are you more profitable? Are your delivering value faster? Have you reduced costs? Have you improved customer loyalty? What about employee satisfaction?

Empiricism is a commitment to seeing reality as it is and dapdating to it. We all have different ways of interpreting the world. Courage allows us to share our view of the world while welcoming that of others. By continuously exposing ourselves to new ideas and acting on them, we receive valuable feedback. Learning from these experiences improves us as human beings and organizations.
